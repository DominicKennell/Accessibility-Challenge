# Challenge_1

Accessibility-Challenege has been developed from a HTML/CSS file given to use by a client. The client, HoriSEOn, wanted to make the website more accessible.

As a result, I added the following for the visually impaired:

- Alt to all images
- Added a navigation tag to the HTML so when the screen is read out to the viewer, the viewer understands there is a navigation bar rather than just an unordered list.
- Added a footer tag to the HTML so so when the screen is read out to the viewer, the viewer understands they have come to the end of the page. Also, it adds semantic value for other people working on the project in the future.
- Added roles to list items for the navigation bar
- Added aria-controls to the list items in the nagivation bar
